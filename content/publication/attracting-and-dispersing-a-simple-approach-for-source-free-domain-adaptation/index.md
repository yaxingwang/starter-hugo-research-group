title: "Attracting and Dispersing: A Simple Approach for Source-free Domain
  Adaptation"
abstract: We propose a simple but effective source-free domain adaptation (SFDA)
  method. Treating SFDA as an unsupervised clustering problem and following the
  intuition that local neighbors in feature space should have more similar
  predictions than other features, we propose to optimize an objective of
  prediction consistency. This objective encourages local neighborhood features
  in feature space to have similar predictions while features farther away in
  feature space have dissimilar predictions, leading to efficient feature
  clustering and cluster assignment simultaneously. For efficient training, we
  seek to optimize an upper-bound of the objective resulting in two simple
  terms. Furthermore, we relate popular existing methods in domain adaptation,
  source-free domain adaptation and contrastive learning via the perspec- tive
  of discriminability and diversity. The experimental results prove the
  superiority of our method, and our method can be adopted as a simple but
  strong baseline for future research in SFDA. Our method can be also adapted to
  source-free open-set and partial-set DA which further shows the generalization
  ability of our method.

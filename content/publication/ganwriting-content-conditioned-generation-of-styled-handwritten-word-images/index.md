title: "GANwriting: content-conditioned generation of styled handwritten word images"
abstract: "Although current image generation methods have reached impressive
  quality levels, they are still unable to produce plausible yet diverse images
  of handwritten words. On the contrary, when writing by hand, a great
  variability is observed across different writers, and even when analyzing
  words scribbled by the same individual, involuntary variations are
  conspicuous. In this work, we take a step closer to producing realistic and
  varied artificially rendered handwriting. We propose a novel method that is
  able to produce credible handwritten word images by conditioning the
  generative process with both calligraphic style features and textual content.
  Our generator is guided by three complementary learning objectives: to produce
  realistic images, to imitate a certain handwriting style and to convey a
  specific textual content. Our model is unconstrained to any predefined
  vocabulary, being able to render whatever input word. Given a sample writer,
  it is also able to mimic its calligraphic features in a few-shot setup. We
  significantly advance over prior art and demonstrate with qualitative,
  quantitative and human-based evaluations the realistic aspect of our
  synthetically produced images."

title: Semi-supervised Learning for Few-shot Image-to-Image Translation
abstract: "In the last few years, unpaired image-to-image translation has
  witnessed Remarkable progress. Although the latest methods are able to
  generate realistic images, they crucially rely on a large number of labeled
  images. Recently, some methods have tackled the challenging setting of
  few-shot image-to-image ranslation, reducing the labeled data requirements for
  the target domain during inference. In this work, we go one step further and
  reduce the amount of required labeled data also from the source domain during
  training. To do so, we propose applying semi-supervised learning via a
  noise-tolerant pseudo-labeling procedure. We also apply a cycle consistency
  constraint to further exploit the information from unlabeled images, either
  from the same dataset or external. Additionally, we propose several structural
  modifications to facilitate the image translation task under these
  circumstances. Our semi-supervised method for few-shot image translation,
  called SEMIT, achieves excellent results on four different datasets using as
  little as 10% of the source labels, and matches the performance of the main
  fully-supervised competitor using only 20% labeled data. Our code and models
  are made public at: https://github. com/yaxingwang/SEMIT."

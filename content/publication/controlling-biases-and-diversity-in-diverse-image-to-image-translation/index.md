abstract: The task of unpaired image-to-image translation is highly challenging
  due to the lack of explicit cross-domain pairs of instances. We consider here
  diverse image translation (DIT), an even more challenging setting in which an
  image can have multiple plausible translations. This is normally achieved by
  explicitly disentangling content and style in the latent representation and
  sampling different styles codes while maintaining the image content. Despite
  the success of current DIT models, they are prone to suffer from bias. In this
  paper, we study the problem of bias in image-to-image translation. Biased
  datasets may add undesired changes (e.g. change gender or race in face images)
  to the output translations as a consequence of the particular underlying
  visual distribution in the target domain. In order to alleviate the effects of
  this problem we propose the use of semantic constraints that enforce the
  preservation of desired image properties. Our proposed model is a step towards
  unbiased diverse image-to-image translation (UDIT), and results in less
  unwanted changes in the translated images while still performing the wanted
  transformation. Experiments on several heavily biased datasets show the
  effectiveness of the proposed techniques in different domains such as faces,
  objects, and scenes.

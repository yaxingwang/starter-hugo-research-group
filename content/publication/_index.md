abstract: Conditional GANs have matured in recent years and are able to generate
  high-quality realistic images. However, the computational resources and the
  training data required for the training of high-quality GANs are enormous, and
  the study of transfer learning of these models is therefore an urgent topic.
  In this paper, we explore the transfer from high-quality pre-trained
  unconditional GANs to conditional GANs. To this end, we propose
  hypernetwork-based adaptive weight modulation. In addition, we introduce a
  self-initialization procedure that does not require any real data to
  initialize the hypernetwork parameters. To further improve the sample
  efficiency of the knowledge transfer, we propose to use a self-supervised
  (contrastive) loss to improve the GAN discriminator. In extensive experiments,
  we validate the efficiency of the hypernetworks, self-initialization and
  contrastive loss for knowledge transfer on several standard benchmarks.

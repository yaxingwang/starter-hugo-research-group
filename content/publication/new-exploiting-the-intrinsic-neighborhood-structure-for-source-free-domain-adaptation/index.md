abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) aims to alleviate the domain shift between
  source domain and target domain. Most DA methods require access to the source
  data, but often that is not possible (eg due to data privacy or intellectual
  property). In this paper, we address the challenging source-free domain
  adaptation (SFDA) problem, where the source pretrained model is adapted to the
  target domain in the absence of source data. Our method is based on the
  observation that target data, which might no longer align with the source
  domain classifier, still forms clear clusters. We capture this intrinsic
  structure by defining local affinity of the target data, and encourage label
  consistency among data with high local affinity. We observe that higher
  affinity should be assigned to reciprocal neighbors, and propose a self
  regularization loss to decrease the negative impact of noisy neighbors.
  Furthermore, to aggregate information with more context, we consider expanded
  neighborhoods with small affinity values. In the experimental results we
  verify that the inherent structure of the target features is an important
  source of information for domain adaptation. We demonstrate that this local
  structure can be efficiently captured by considering the local neighbors, the
  reciprocal neighbors, and the expanded neighborhood. Finally, we achieve
  state-of-the-art performance on several 2D image and 3D point cloud
  recognition datasets.

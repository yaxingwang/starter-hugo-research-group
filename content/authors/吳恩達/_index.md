Yaxing is an associate professor of college of computer science at Nankai University. His research interests include GANs, image-to-image translation, domain adaptation and lifelong learning. 

Prior to joining NKU I was a  postdoc at UAB, CVC, working with **[ ](https://billf.mit.edu/)**[Joost van de Weije.](http://www.cvc.uab.es/LAMP/joost/) I obtained my Ph.D. from Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, under the supervision of [Joost van de Weijer](http://www.cvc.uab.es/LAMP/joost/).  I also experienced amazing internship at IIAI with [Fahad shahbaz khan](https://sites.google.com/view/fahadkhans/home) and [Salman Khan](https://salman-h-khan.github.io/).
